- **Module:** this field simply describes the module name.
- **Storyboad based:** this field is used to determine whether your view is built in Storyboard.
- **Subclass of:** in this field, you must choose from which class your View should inherit from.
- **Also create XIB file for user interface:** if checkbox is checked XIB file will be created inside your module.
- **Also create Router file:** if checkbox is checked your module will have Router class.

### Structure

After creating the module, you will see that several files were created based on your choice. Unfortunately, folder structuring is only available for Project templates, so all files will be created in one folder.
